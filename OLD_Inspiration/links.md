[Deck Overview](http://www.angelpaths.com/tarotl.html)

The Tarot is more than a simple pack of cards. The pack itself comprises 78 cards which combine to form the 'arcana' - symbolic representations of ancient wisdom. Twenty two of these are the 'Major Arcana'. The 56 'Minor' cards are split into the four elemental suits of Earth, Water, Fire and Air.

In the following pages we explore the vast, mysterious and beautiful world of the Tarot. We have split up the cards into the five sections - Major Arcana plus four Minor Arcana Suits. Click on the images below or the links to visit each section.


[The Major Arcana](http://www.angelpaths.com/tarotmaj.html)

he Major Arcana are profoundly symbolic and each card offers almost endless opportunities for study and interpretation on many levels. Seen separately, each card teaches us about a different part of our life. Combined, they present us with a complete view of the Universe.

There are 22 Major Arcana - the same as the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet and the same as the number of paths on the Tree of Life. This Tree of Life is one representation of the secrets of divine truth and is part of the Quabbalah (or Cabala).
